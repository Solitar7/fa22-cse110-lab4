17. [2,4,6]. The function takes an array [1,2,3] and a function as input, then creates a new array to return. By using a for loop, it loops through the original array and takes each value out and apply it to the function, which is just multiply it by 2, and then push it into the new array. After looping through the whole array, it returns the new array, which is just the twice of all values of each value in the original array correspondingly. Thus, the result is [2,4,6].
